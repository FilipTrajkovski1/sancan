            <h2>I Didn’t Always Believe in Myself</h2>
            <p>
                There was a time when I looked confident on the outside,

                but inside I was constantly questioning myself.

                I overthought everything.

                I second-guessed my decisions.

                I looked to others for validation because I didn’t trust my own voice.

                I thought confidence was something you were born with.

                I thought self-doubt meant something was wrong with me.

                I was wrong.

            <h2>The Turning Point</h2>

            <p>
                The moment everything changed wasn’t loud or dramatic.

                It was quiet.

                It was the moment I realized that waiting to “feel ready” was keeping me stuck.

                I saw that my lack of confidence wasn’t a personality flaw—

                <strong>it was a learned response.</strong>
            </p>

        <div class="right">

                Years of:
                <li>people-pleasing</li>

                <li>suppressing my emotions</li>

                <li>prioritizing others over myself</li>

                <li>ignoring my intuition</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                had taught me to shrink.

                And I made a decision.

                Not to become someone new—

                but to come back to myself.

        <h2>What I Learned (And What Changed Everything) </h2>
        <div>
            <ul>
                I learned that:
                <li><strong>Confidence is built, not found</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Self-trust is a daily practice</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Boundaries are an act of self-love</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Emotional safety creates confidenc</strong></li>
                <li><strong>You don’t heal by pushing harder—you heal by listening</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                As I began doing the inner work—

                rewiring my self-talk,

                regulating my nervous system,

                honoring my needs,

                and taking aligned action—

                something <b>shifted</b>.

                I stopped asking for permission.

                I stopped explaining myself.

                I stopped abandoning myself to keep the peace.

                And confidence stopped <strong>feeling forced</strong>.

        <h2>The Result</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="left">
                <p>
                    Today, I move through life grounded, calm, and self-assured.

                    Not because life is perfect—

                    but because I trust myself.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    I know how to:
                    <li><b>regulate my emotions</b></li>
                    <li><b>make decisions without fear</b></li>

                    <li><b>hold boundaries without guilt</b></li>
                    <li><b>lead my life from alignment, not insecurity</b></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    And the most powerful part?

                    This wasn’t magic.

                    It was learnable.

                    Why I Coach Individuals with this need Now?<br>

                    I didn’t become a self-improvement and self-confidence coach because I mastered life.

                    I became one because I walked through self-doubt

                    and found a way out.

                    And I also know that you don’t need fixing.
                    You need:
                    <li><b>safety within yourself</b></li>
                    <li><b>guidance</b></li>
                    <li><b>consistency</b></li>
